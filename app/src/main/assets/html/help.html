    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">NoiseCapture App is an application dedicated
      to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">evaluation of your noise
        environment</span>. It allows to perform measurements and, thus, to give
      information on your noise exposure. In addition, you can contribute to the
      realization of collaborative (or community) noise maps by <span style="font-weight: bold;">anonymously</span>
      sharing your measurements.</p>

    <p class="p_warning">NoiseCapture App is an application, made by experts,
      but do not forget that it will never replace a professional sonometer. If
      you need a professional assistance, please contact a specialist.</p>
    <p class="p_warning">The quality of the measurement depend of the technical
      performance of the smartphone. Depending of the smartphone and the android
      version, some smartphone may produce bad estimation of the sound level.
      See <a href="#measurement_limits">section concerning the limits of noise
        measurement</a> with a smartphone for more information.</p>
    <h2> <a name="start_measurment"></a>Start a measurement</h2>
    On the <strong>Measurement</strong> menu item, press the <span style="font-weight: bold;">RECORD
      button</span> to start a measurement. You can stop the measurement by
    pressing the <span style="font-weight: bold;">STOP button</span>. <br>
    <p class="p_tip">You can pause/resume a measurement using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">PAUSE
        button</span>. Depending on the corresponding <span style="font-weight: bold;">Settings</span>
      value, when resuming the measurement, the last seconds of the measurement
      can be removed.</p>
    What is displaying? <br>
    <ul>
      <li>a horizontal level-meter and a numeric value showing the <span style="font-weight: bold;">instantaneous
          sound level</span> ('fast' level on 125ms) in dB(A) (A-weighted
        decibel). The color depend on the level range (each level range of 5dB
        is associated to a given color);</li>
      <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">statistical sound levels</span> in
        dB(A): minimum (Min), maximum (Max) and the mean (Mean) values of the
        fast sound level;</li>
      <li>a <span style="font-weight: bold;">chronometer</span> that gives the
        measurement duration in second;</li>
      <li>an information is given concerning the <span style="font-weight: bold;">GPS
          localization accuracy</span>;</li>
      <li>a <span style="font-weight: bold;">noise level spectrum</span>,
        showing the instantaneous sound level for each third-octave band between
        100Hz and 16kHz. If you tap on the spectrum, it displays a <span style="font-weight: bold;">time-frequency
          representation of noise</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> <a name="give_a_description"></a>Give a description</h2>
    <p>On the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span> menu item:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>add a 'Description' <em>,</em> if needed;</li>
      <li>add a 'Picture <em>',</em> if needed;</li>
      <li>evaluate the <em>Pleasantness</em> of the sound environment, by
        moving the cursor from 'Unpleasant' to 'Pleasant';</li>
      <li>select one on more 'Tags' that correspond to your perception of the
        sound environment;</li>
      <li>valid the description by pressing the <span style="font-weight: bold;">VALID
          button</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p_inf">This step is optional but it could be useful to evaluate
      the noise environments, as well as for a research purpose. Your
      contribution will be highly appreciated. Only the anonymous elements
      'Pleasantness' and 'Tags' are uploads. The 'Description', as well as, the
      'Picture', are stored on your smartphone only and, thus, not uploaded.</p>
    <h2> <a name="analyse_results"></a>Analyze results</h2>
    <p>On the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Results</span> menu item, you
      can access to several noise indicators.</p>
    <p>While during measurements sound level are displayed in a 'fast' mode
      (125ms), final results are given in a 'slow' mode (1s), based on the 1s
      (one second) equivalent sound level (Leq,1s). Leq,1s is a standard
      environmental noise indicator, used for the evaluation of noise annoyance.</p>
    <p>What is displaying?</p>
    <ul>
      <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">statistical sound levels</span> in
        dB(A): minimum (Min) and maximum (Max);</li>
      <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">percentile noise levels</span> in
        dB(A) over the whole measurement duration:
        <ul>
          <li>LA90: A-weighted noise level that is exceeded for 90% of the
            measurement period. LA90 is a useful descriptor to quantify the <span

              style="font-weight: bold;">background noise level</span>;</li>
          <li>LA50: A-weighted noise level that is exceeded for 50% of the
            measurement period. LA50 is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">median
              sound level</span>;</li>
          <li>LA10: A-weighted noise level that is exceeded for 10% of the
            measurement period. LA10 is a useful descriptor of road traffic
            noise, which is correlated with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">noise
              annoyance</span>;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">equivalent noise level</span> in
        dB(A), on the whole measurement duration [at the center of colored
        circle];</li>
      <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">repartition of the noise exposure</span>
        (RNE): this indicator represents the distribution over the time of your
        noise exposure. Each of the five colors correspond to a given noise
        level range.</li>
      <li>a <span style="font-weight: bold;">noise level spectrum</span>,
        showing the sound level for each third-octave band between 100Hz and
        16kHz.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> <a name="explore_the_map"></a>Explore the map</h2>
    <p>On the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Map</span> menu item, users can
      access to a geo-referenced representation of the measurement that are
      stored in the smartphone memory. Users can choose to represent:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>'Selected record', which corresponds to the last measurement or to a
        loaded previous measurement (see <a href="#explore_history">History</a>
        for information);</li>
      <li>'All records' stored in the smartphone memory;</li>
      <li>'Community noise map': this noise map that is built using all data
        produced by all participating citizen. This noise map is stored on the
        web server and need an internet access to be displayed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> <a name="explore_history"></a>Explore the measurement history</h2>
    <p>On the <span style="font-weight: bold;">History</span> menu item, users
      can access to all measurements that are stored in the smartphone memory.</p>
    <p>All measurement that are performed with the smartphone are archived in
      the history. You can access to the state of the measurement ('Upload' or
      'Not upload' to the server) with the 'Cloud' symbol,</p>
    <p>By tapping on item from the history, you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>'Upload to the community': if the corresponding measurement has not be
        automatically uploaded to the server, you can process to a manual
        upload;</li>
      <li>'Export result': using a given application (message, drive...), you
        can export/save a ZIP file that contains all the metadata of the
        measurement. See the README document in the ZIP file for the description
        of the metadata. This is the same ZIP file that is upload to the web
        server;</li>
      <li>'Edit description': you can modify the description of the
        corresponding measurement (same as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span>
        menu item). If the item has been already uploaded to the server, you can
        only modify the text description and the picture;</li>
      <li>'Show result': you can access to the results of corresponding
        measurement (same as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Results</span>
        menu item);</li>
      <li>'Show on map': you can access to the map for the spatial
        representation of corresponding measurement (same as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Map</span>
        menu item);</li>
      <li>'Delete': select this option if you want to remove the measurement
        from your smartphone.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p_inf">If a measurement is removed from the history, but was
      previously transferred to the web server, it is not removed from the web
      server. Remember that all data that are uploaded to the server are
      anonymized; thus, be confident! (see <a href="about.html">Privacy</a>)</p>
    <h2> <a name="smartphone_calibration"></a>Calibrate your smartphone</h2>
    <p>On the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Calibration</span> menu item,
      users have the opportunity to calibrate their smartphone.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The methodology is based on the knowledge of a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reference
          value</span> for the equivalent noise level Leq (in dB, not in dB(A))
        for a given duration, from a reference device (an acoustic calibrator, a

      <li>Depending on the calibration method, the calibration can be performed
        for a given frequency band or for the full range (global value).</li>
      <li>This <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reference value</span> is then
        compared to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Measured Leq</span>
        (in dB) using the smartphone. The difference between these two values
        gives a <span style="font-weight: bold;">correction factor</span> (i.e.

      <li>Audio input sensitivity SHOULD be set such that a 90dB sound power
        level (SPL) source at 1000Hz yields RMS of 2500 for 16-bit samples.</li>
      <li>PCM amplitude levels SHOULD linearly track input SPL changes over at
        least a 30dB range from -18dB to +12dB re 90 dB SPL at the microphone.</li>
      <li>Total harmonic distortion SHOULD be less than 1% for 1kHz at 90dB SPL
        input level at the microphone.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, it is specified that " <em>While some of the requirements
        outlined in this section are stated as SHOULD since Android 4.3, the
        Compatibility Definition for a future version is planned to change these
        to MUST. Existing and new Android devices are very strongly encouraged
        to meet these requirements, or they will not be able to attain Android
        compatibility when upgraded to the future version.</em>"</p>
    <h4> <span style="color: #0099cc;">What does it theoretically means?</span>
    </h4>
    Thus, the quality of the noise measurement:
    <ul>
      <li>depends both of the device and of the Android version.</li>
      <li>should be quite verified between 100Hz and 4000Hz (frequency
        response).</li>
      <li>should be quite linear (amplitude response) in a range from -18dB to
        +12dB relatively to 90dB (Sound Pressure Level).</li>
    </ul>
    <p> <span style="color: #ffcc66;">In conclusion, in the current situation,
        even after a rigorous calibration and without any further correction, it
        is not possible to ensure the quality of the measurement for low and
        high noise levels, as well as, beyond 4000Hz, whatever the device and
        the Android version. One can however assume that next smartphone
        generations should ensure a better measurement quality.</span> </p>
    <!-- <h4><span style="color: #0099cc;">What does it means in practice?</span></h4>
    <p>There are few scientific references in the corresponding literature,      discussing the possibility of using smartphones for measuring      environmental noise.</p>    <ul>      <li>On can also cite the work by [Murhpy, 2016], comparing several Android        and iOS Apps, on many different smartphones. Particularly, the results        show that there is a relationship between the phone age and the quality        of measurement, and, in addition, that iOS Apps gives the best results,        compared to Android Apps!</li>      <li>From [Aumond, 2016], in the context of noise pollution in urban areas,        it seems that after calibrating smartphones with a correction factor        that depends of the sound level (because the the amplitude response of        the smartphone is not linear with the sound level), instantaneous sound        levels measured using smartphones, as well as LA50 and LA90 (over a        duration of 10mn), are very well correlated with reference measurements.        </li>    </ul>    </p>-->
    <h2> <a name="best_pratice"></a>Best practice for the best noise
      measurement</h2>
    <p> <span style="color: #0099cc;">In order to perform a correct noise
        measurement:</span> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The smartphone must be <span style="font-weight: bold;">calibrated</span>
        (see <a href="#smartphone_calibration">Calibration</a>);</li>
      <li>The smartphone must be <span style="font-weight: bold;">outside the
          clothing pockets</span>;</li>
      <li>The smartphone has to be <span style="font-weight: bold;">in the hand</span>;</li>
      <li>The smartphone microphone <span style="font-weight: bold;">must not
          to be masked</span>;</li>
      <li>If possible, uses an <span style="font-weight: bold;">external
          omnidirectional microphone</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    <span style="color: #0099cc;">In addition, if you want to produce noise
      measurements that will be very useful for producing collaborative
      (outdoor) noise maps, please check these points:</span> <br>
    <ul>
      <li>The measurement must be <span style="font-weight: bold;">performed
          outside buildings</span>;</li>
      <li>The measurement must be done when the <span style="font-weight: bold;">GPS
          signal is correct</span>;</li>
      <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">'Tags' must be specified</span>
        when the measurement is complete (see <a href="#give_a_description">Description</a>).</li>
