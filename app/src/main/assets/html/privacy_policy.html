    <p align="center"><b>Version 1.0 - March 7th 2017</b></p>

    <p align="justify">This privacy policy governs your use of the software application NoiseCapture App ("Application") for mobile devices. </p>

    <p>The Application was created (and is managed) by two French research institutes, Ifsttar &amp; CNRS ("Us").</p>
    
    <p align="justify">NoiseCapture App is a mobile application dedicated to the <b>evaluation of the noise environment</b>. It allows to perform noise measurements
      and, thus, to give information on your noise exposure. In addition, if you agree, you can contribute to the realization of collaborative (or community) noise maps by <b>anonymously</b> sharing your measurements with the Community.</p>

    <p align="justify">All collected data, which can be sent to a remote server (managed by Ifsttar &amp; CNRS) with the prior agreement of the User, are <b>used for scientific researches</b>, <b>in order to propose representations of the noise environment and of the community noise exposition</b>.</p>

    <p align="justify">Because the Application is developed as an Open Source project (under <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.en.html" target="blank">GPLv3</a> licence), everyone has the ability to study the code itself:

    <h2>1. What information does the Application obtain?</h2>


<!-- H3 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h3>User Registration</h3>

    <p>There is no Registration.</p>


<!-- H3 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h3>User Provided Information</h3>

    <p>The Application obtains the information you may <u>optionally</u> provide when you use the Application, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For the purposes of <b>the User only</b>:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>a Description of the noise measurement (optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>a Picture (using the mobile camera) to describe the noise measurement (optional)</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"  align="justify">The Description and the Picture are solely used for and by the User and are stored on the mobile storage only. They are optional and are not uploaded to a remote server. We DON't collect any of these information.</div>
    <br>
        <ul>
      <li>In addition, you can also provide information concerning your own evaluation of the noise environment, which can be useful for <b>the Community</b>:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>an information concerning the Pleasantness of the noise environment (optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>pre-defined Tags for description of the noise environment (optional)</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"  align="justify">The Pleasantness and the Tags can be useful for the assessment of the noise environment. These information are optional. They can be sent to the remote server, only with the prior agreement of the User.</div>
    <strong> </strong>

<!-- H3 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h3>Collected Information</h3>

<!-- H4 -------------------------------------------------->
    <h4>For the evaluation of the noise environment</h4>

    <p  align="justify">When the User runs the Application, it allows the Application to collect information ("Noise Environment Information") that are required for the evaluation of the noise environment. For collecting these
      information, it requires an action from the User, <i>i.e.</i> by pressing the record/stop buttons AND by authorizing the upload of the data to the remote server in the Application settings (uploading is set by default). There is NO automatic NOR background task for collecting these information.</p>

    <p align="justify">To collect Noise Environment Information, the Application requires the following device permissions:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Audio recording:</dt>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dd>The Application uses the microphone to proceed to noise level measurements and to compute Noise Indicators. There is NO audio-recording, NOR speech recognition NOR any method of obtaining any
        information about the User or the surrounding discussions. Only standard noise indicators are computed.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Geo-localization:</dt>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dd>The Application may use GPS technology (or other similar technology) to determine the noise measurement location and time (a Track). If you do not want us to use your location for the purposes set forth above, you should turn off the location services in your mobile phone settings.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Network connection information:</dt>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dd>The Application may send Noise Environment Information to a remote server. This requires information concerning the available network connections. If you don't want the Application to use a network
        connection, or if you want to select the internet connection to use, you should turn off or select the corresponding services in the Application settings or in your mobile phone settings.<span

          class="Apple-converted-space"></span></dd>
    </dl>
    <h4></h4>

<!-- H4 -------------------------------------------------->    
    <h4>For data quality assessment and extra-processing</h4>

    <p align="justify">
    The Application collects additional information ("General Information"): the type of mobile device you use (product, model, manufacturer) and the version of the Application. These information are only used in order to be able to perform extra-processing of the Noise Environment Information, on the remote server. For example, we could be able to easily correct all measurements that have been carried out with the same type of mobile phone or using the same version of the Application.</p>
    <p align="justify">
    We DON'T collect your Universally Unique Device Identifier (UUID) NOR any other information that could help identify a specific User. Instead, we create a Random Identifier (RI) at each installation of the Application (the RI is displayed at the top of the 'About' page of the menu Application). This identifier may be used, for example, on the remote server to realize extra-processing of the Noise Environment Information(such as post-calibration) on a set of data with the same RI.</p>


<!-- H4 -------------------------------------------------->
    <h4> Data storage</h4>
    The Application may store information locally on your mobile device using application data caches and mobile storage.

    <h3>Information you share</h3>

    <p align="justify">
    The Application let you share information with others, using for example social networks or data exportation. This responsibility belongs to you.</p>


<!-- H3 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h3>Information we don't share</h3>

    <p align="justify">
    As previously stated, the Description and the Picture provided by the User, are solely used by the User and are stored on the mobile storage only. They are not uploaded to a remote server. We DON'T collect these information; thus, we CAN NOT share these information.</p>


<!-- H3 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

    <p align="justify">
    General information and Noise Environment Information may be shared with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.</p>
    <p align="justify">

    <h2>3. How we use information that are collected with the Application?</h2>

    <p align="justify">
    As presented before, NoiseCapture App is dedicated to the<b> representations and the assessment of the noise environment, within a scientific context.</b> Consequently, all the collected data are used for this purpose. Only anonymous data are uploaded to the remote server, without any means of associating them with any User. All anonymous community data (<i>i.e.</i> produced by the entire user community) are then post-processed on the remote server in order to study and to display the noise environment, for example, to obtain noise maps.</p>

    <p align="justify">Because these data can be useful for the community, they can also be shared with the community, in respect to the prevent Privacy Policy and under the Open Database Licence (<a href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/" target="blank">ODbL</a>).</p>
